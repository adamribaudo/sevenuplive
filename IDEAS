Ideas for Features/Improvements

- Load Scales from XML Files
 Ability to load a melodizer scales from an XML file and have it associated with a custom name and appear in the pick list. 
 
 - Schema for 7up Live Patch format (Validation)
 XML improvements like XML validation of patches...pretty printing of XML so it is easier to edit.
 
- Controller Page
  Ability to send all control changes when moving between control pages.
  Ability to have each controller page send different CCs for more mapping options
  Ability to change values smoothly. For example, smooth fade out.
  
- More quantization options
Ability to start/stop loops and loop recorder slot quantized to step or bar. Use the navcol start/stop and masterizer start/stop buttons only. Still allow triggering of loop steps unquantized. If launching from quantized button then chokes are also quantized.

- Mute capabilities + Sub Mixing of Loop Tracks 
Change Looper racks to use Drum Racks instead of Device Racks which will allow return chains. The allows each loop to be 
routed to different audio sub mixes, group mutes etc...plus different effect racks in each submix.
