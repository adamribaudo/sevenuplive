Ideas for Features/Improvements

- Load Scales from XML Files
 Ability to load a melodizer scales from an XML file and have it associated with a custom name and appear in the pick list. 
 
 - Midi Scale Learn mode
 Click "Learn" button in 7up. Now start playing a scale from lowest note on up. 
 The monome grid, every note lights a button in order as the scale is assigned to each button slot on the monome.
 Now save and name your new scale. Awesome for just picking great notes for individual projects. Scale is saved with patch and can 
 also be saved as a spearate file for loading into other patches.
 
 - Option to hide keyboard in Melodizer.
 Option to hide the keyboard in Melodizer and gain more notes. Also helpful for 64 fingers mode where each pad is mapped to a sample
 using chromatic scale and no need for a keyboard.
 
 - Schema for 7up Live Patch format (Validation)
 XML improvements like XML validation of patches...pretty printing of XML so it is easier to edit.
 
 - Patch Packs
 Ability to save, load, create Patch Packs. Ability to have patch packs reference patches on the filesystem (an option) and save changes to patches in the pack. Ability to create self-contained patch packs as well.
 
 - Controller Page
  Ability to send all control changes when moving between control pages.
  Ability to have each controller page send different CCs for more mapping options
  Ability to change values smoothly. For example, smooth fade out.
  
- More quantization options
Ability to start/stop loops and loop recorder slot quantized to step or bar. Use the navcol start/stop and masterizer start/stop buttons only. Still allow triggering of loop steps unquantized. If launching from quantized button then chokes are also quantized.

- Mute capabilities
I think this is a template feature. Ability to assign loops to return chains in template and map buttons to mute on each return chain.
