v2.0.5

- Added velocity support to Melodizers
On melodizer 1, midi input to ch9 on track that SevenUpCore is in will record 
notes to pattern recorders. Velocity will now be recorded as well. 

There are three custom OSC protocol messages specific to 7up and not included 
in the monome osc protocol.

For v1 classic protocol these are

/refresh - Force 7up to redraw the entire surface, rather than the 
standard draw mode that only redraws what has changed. This was needed for 
manta support, because we move the draw window and need a way to force a full
redraw.

Multi-level led support for v2 monomes. Monomes that support multi-intensity leds 
can use this mode which is very friendly on the bandwidth since it trades fast
blinks for led levels. Current pattern still fast blinks. Record enable still 
slow binks.

Tilt support added for serialosc

/xpress x y v - Same as /press but with extra param for velocity.
if you send osc button press messages to SevenUp and add an extra integer OSC 
param at the end, SevenUp will interpret this as velocity input. 
This is how the manta patch works, an app could also use an ARC or encoder 
to modify the velocity range and send this with button presses.

The messages are slightly different when using v2 serialosc protocol since the 
path look slightly different in v2 messages.
 
/grid/refresh
/grid/xkey x y v 

BUG FIXES

Fixed tilt support for gs128. For some reason the protocol type tags were 
different for the gs128. Anyway, it works now.
