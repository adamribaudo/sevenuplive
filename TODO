BUGS
-clearing a melodizer pattern should remove it's blinking light from the masterizer
- When loading a patch, patternizers do not update their UI until you move away from page and come back again
- SamplePatchPack.xml is not really a patch pack. Needs to be updated.
- Check "NextPatch" clip in template...It was sending an F3 instead of the F4 needed to change the patch.
- There was a bug report that loop pattern recorder was not replaying loops that used choke groups properly. This may have to do
which where new notes are triggered or not depending on loop mode.
